## üìù Introduction

**Abstract:**  
Heart failure is a major public health challenge with growing costs. Ejection fraction (EF) is a key metric for the diagnosis and management of heart failure. However, estimating EF using echocardiography is expensive and requires extensive expertise. An existing deep learning model is able to identify EF from chest x-rays, which are quick, inexpensive, and require less expertise. However, this model requires enormous computational resources to train and has inequitable performance across race.

This project introduces a model that distinguishes EF in chest x-rays using image embeddings from the MIMIC dataset. Compared to the existing model trained for the same task on raw images, the proposed model performs similarly while significantly reducing the computational resources needed for training and updating. Upon further model analysis based on race, gender, and insurance, the proposed embedding model shows performance disparities that correlate with representation in the dataset. A final discussion on bias in clinical settings contextualizes the model within the broader American healthcare system.

Due to HIPAA regulations and the sensitive nature of the data used, the full codebase and raw datasets for this project cannot be shared publicly. The dataset used is **‚ÄúGeneralized Image Embeddings for the MIMIC Chest X-Ray‚Äù**, which requires credentialed access and human subjects training through PhysioNet.
