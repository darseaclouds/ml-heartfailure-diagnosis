# ml-heartfailure-diagnosis
This repo contains the code to build a novel computer vision's based heart failure diagnosing model from chest x-rays using state of the art ML techniques.

In acoordance with HIPPA, I cannot share the sensitive medical data used to train this model. However, this repo shows my coding, data analysis, and ml engineering skills. Please read the final-paper.pdf for full project description.
